Welcome to VI Java API Beta Release. 

WHAT IS VI JAVA API?
VI Java API is a set of Java libraries that aim to ease the usage of VI 
SDK Web Services interfaces. It's now open-sourced under BSD license.

It provides the following benefits to the Java developers:

* Enables OO programming with a well defined managed object model
* Reduces the need to use ManagedObjectReference and makes possible 
  compile time type checking
* Hides the complexity of the PropertyCollector
* Provides necessary utility classes to simplify VI SDK web interfaces
* High performance with 4+ times faster than AXIS engine

As a result, the application code using this API is much shorter (70% less) 
and much more readable than the equivalent using web service interfaces 
directly. The API itself is straight-forward and easy to learn and use. 

WHAT IS INCLUDED?
Everything is packaged into one Jar file, including the Java source code, 
binary, sample code, license.
Version 2.0 includes a high performance web service engine which is 15+ times
faster in loading and 4+ faster in de-serialization than AXIS with only 1/4
of the size.

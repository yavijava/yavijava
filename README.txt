Welcome to VI Java API 2.0 release 

WHAT IS VI JAVA API?
VI Java API is a set of Java libraries that aim to ease the usage of VI 
SDK Web Services interfaces. It's now open-sourced under BSD license.

It provides the following benefits to the Java developers:
* Enables OO programming with a well defined managed object model
* Reduces the need to use ManagedObjectReference and makes possible 
  compile time type checking
* Hides the complexity of the PropertyCollector
* Provides necessary utility classes to simplify VI SDK web interfaces
* High performance with 4+ times faster than AXIS engine

As a result, the application code using this API is much shorter (70% less) 
and much more readable than the equivalent using web service interfaces 
directly. The API itself is straight-forward and easy to learn and use. 

WHO CREATED THE API?
The VI Java API was initially created by Steve Jin from VMware Engineering. 
He is the author of VMware VI and vSphere SDK by Prentice Hall. There are 
contributions from the communities as well. See the web site for more details.  

WHAT IS INCLUDED?
Everything is packaged into one Jar file, including the Java source code, 
binary, sample code, license.
Version 2.0 includes a high performance web service engine which is 15+ times
faster in loading and 4+ faster in de-serialization than AXIS with only 1/4
of the size, and many other features. Find out more at project home.
